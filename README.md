# Polya Tree and Mixture of Polya Tree for one sample analysis

This is a simple implementation of the Polya Tree and Mixture of Polya Tree priors based on the paper "Parametric Nonparametric Statistics: An Introduction to Mixtures of Finite Polya Trees" by Christensen et al. We did this both in R (as Rmd file, for initial brainstorm of idea), and in Rcpp (a more performant implementation and more room to improve). In the future, we are looking forward to improve the runtime and allow for more type of inference for the model.
